if you want to start a project in grpc well, i hope this "guide" might help...
because the internet is not a friend in this.

1. First, let's define a gRPC service using protocol buffers,
Here we define a request messages, a response messages, and a service with RPC methods

example is in the proto folder (also ypu need to make sure the server and client have the same proto)

2. Now we will have to compile the .proto file using proto compile
(lines to write in the proto folder)
this is done so we can access the message types, services and call the methods using your prefered language. Each language has its own proto compiler.
here i used python and js-web

3. then we write the server, This file will contain the gRPC server code.
you need to there the files you compiled in the previos step

4. create an envoy.yaml in the root of this React.js folder. This is Envoy's config file that Docker will use to set up an Envoy process running.
This sets the URL address of the gRPC server where the Envoy proxy will direct its HTTP/2 calls.
and create a Dockerfile in the same place as envoy.yaml

5. after that you can write your client and presentesional page

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to run this code:
- server:
    py greet_server.py
- client:
    npm start
- docker:
    docker build -t greet_service .
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 9901:9901 greet_service
